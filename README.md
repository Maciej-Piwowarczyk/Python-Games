# Python-Games
A collection of small games for recreation and for learning Python
Games in the order that I add them and a small description of each:

01_Hangman
  A warm-up project as I got back into Python. Nothing fancy, it was just meant to function

02_Dodge_THIS
  My first attempt at using the pygame package. Introduced me to user inputs (arrow keys) and the basics of pygame
