# Python-Games
A collection of small games for recreation and for learning Python
Games in the order that I add them and a small description of each:

01 - A simple hang-man game meant to be a warm-up as I got back into Python.

02 - A dodging game and my first attempt at using the pygame package. Introduced me to user inputs (arrow keys) and the basics of pygame.

03 - Five different examples of generating (sometimes bad) psuedorandom sequences. Used in a presentation about psuedorandom number generators.

04 - An ambitious platforming game complete with level select, custom object collision detection, and the most cubish of protagonists. A continuation of my pygame education.
